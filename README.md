# Erlang Tips, Training & Programming guide


Some Erlang tools, libs and a lot of funs ;-)


## 1. Erlang in short

Erlang is a  concurrent and functional programming language whose development favors practicability over purity. It is production oriented. Along with its concurrency characteristics, Erlang also benefits from these interesting properties:

  - **scalability**; because concurrency relies onto small, independant programs, easy to scale up;

  - **fault-tolerance**; it was specifically built to protect against faillures;

  - **soft real-time**; no degradation under heavy loads thanks to a predictable response time and latency;

  - **distributed**; able to manage millions of processes efficiently by taking the best ofthanks to an efficient use of any multi-cores, multi-processors architecture.
  
The syntax of Erlang share this same philosophy, lean, efficient, straightforward and delicious.

01_Erlang_basics              :: The basics about the Erlang programming language, sequential and also concurrent programming;

02_Erlang_idioms              :: Constructions specific to Erlang or, sometimes to the functional programming languages. An aparte, because they are essential, either to Erlang or to the functional programming scheme.

03_Distributed_Erlang         :: Distributed Erlang, or concurrent Erlang
A main feature of this programming language.

04_Erlang_Problems_Solutions  :: Some exerices and problems. Most of them are derived from the Erlang official documentation, others come from the referenced books listed at the bottom of this page.
