Some Erlang tools, libs and a lot of funs ;-)


01 :: The basics about the Erlang programming language, sequential and also concurrent programming;

02 :: Constructions specific to Erlang or, sometimes to the functional programming languages. An aparte, because they are essential, either to Erlang or to the functional programming scheme.

03 :: Distributed Erlang, or concurrent Erlang
A main feature of this programming language.

04 :: Some exerices and problems. Most of them are derived from the Erlang official documentation, others come from books:
- *Programming Erlang* by Joe Armstrong,
- *Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP* by Franceso Cesarini and Steve Vinovski,
- *Erlang and OTP in action* by Martin Logan, Eric Merritt and Richard Carlsson and
