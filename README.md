Some Erlang tools, libs and a lot of funs ;-)

01 :: The basics about the Erlang programming language, sequential and also concurrent programming;

02 :: Constructions specific to Erlang or, sometimes to the functional programming languages. An aparte, because they are essential,
either to Erlang or to the functional programming scheme.
