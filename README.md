# Erlang Tips, Training & Programming guide


Some Erlang tools, libs and a lot of funs ;-)


1. Erlang in short

Erlang is a  concurrent and functional programming language whose development favors practicability over purity. It is production oriented. Thanks to its concurrency characteristics, Erlang also benefits from these interesting properties:

  • ** scalability **, because concurrency is build thanks to small, independant programs;

  • __fault-tolerance__, Erlang was specifically built to resist and protect against faillures;

• __soft real-time __

• **distributed**.


01 :: The basics about the Erlang programming language, sequential and also concurrent programming;

02 :: Constructions specific to Erlang or, sometimes to the functional programming languages. An aparte, because they are essential, either to Erlang or to the functional programming scheme.

03 :: Distributed Erlang, or concurrent Erlang
A main feature of this programming language.

04 :: Some exerices and problems. Most of them are derived from the Erlang official documentation, others come from books:
- *Programming Erlang* by Joe Armstrong,
- *Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP* by Franceso Cesarini and Steve Vinovski,
- *Erlang and OTP in action* by Martin Logan, Eric Merritt and Richard Carlsson and
- *Learn you some Erlang for great good* by Fred Hébert.
