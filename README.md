# Erlang Tips, Training & Programming guide


Some Erlang tools, libs and a lot of funs ;-)


## 1. In short

### 1.a. Erlang

Erlang is a  concurrent and functional programming language whose development favors practicability over purity. It is production oriented. It's syntax follows this same philosophy, lean, efficient and straightforward. Thanks to its concurrency characteristics, Erlang also benefits from these interesting properties:

  - **scalability**; because concurrency relies onto small, independant programs;

  - **fault-tolerance**; it was specifically built to protect against faillures;

  - **soft real-time**; thanks to an efficient usage of any multi-cores, multi-processors architecture;

  - **distributed**; another Erlang's strength, it can manage millions of processes efficiently. Actually, the more, the more performant it becomes.


### 1.b. Functional programming

It is all about function.



01 :: The basics about the Erlang programming language, sequential and also concurrent programming;

02 :: Constructions specific to Erlang or, sometimes to the functional programming languages. An aparte, because they are essential, either to Erlang or to the functional programming scheme.

03 :: Distributed Erlang, or concurrent Erlang
A main feature of this programming language.

04 :: Some exerices and problems. Most of them are derived from the Erlang official documentation, others come from books:
- *Programming Erlang - Sofware for a concurrent World* by Joe Armstrong,
- *Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP* by Franceso Cesarini and Steve Vinovski,
- *Erlang and OTP in action* by Martin Logan, Eric Merritt and Richard Carlsson and
- *Learn you some Erlang for great good* by Fred HÃ©bert.
